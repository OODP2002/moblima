SC2002 - Movie Booking and Listing Management Application 

# Running the application
When running the application, the user directory has to be the source code directory.

## main method
The main method is within the MOBLIMA.java. Can be run directly from there if one is using a IDE.

### Admin Credentials
The credentials for the Admin login are within the credentials.txt file.

### MovieGoer Credentials
The credentials will match directly to a past user if they have bought a ticket previously. This means that the name, mobile and email will have to be identical to view previous ticket history. If not, the new Movie-Goer will be created. These details will be saved within the ticket as well.
